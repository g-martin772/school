# Abstract

The walk-through procedure is a method employed to gather data about the actual execution of business processes.
It is used to identify and verify business processes, determine processing and throughput times, and ascertain the 
frequency of occurrence of process variants.  The procedure is divided into three main stages:  

Preparation: This involves defining the objective of the survey, the procedure, and the area of investigation. 
Coding is used to simplify data collection, and a walk-through sheet is created. The forms used can be structured, 
unstructured, or partially structured.  

Implementation: This stage involves the distribution of survey documents, which depends on new or ongoing processes. 
Entries are made on the walk-through sheet, and activities and times are documented.  

Evaluation: This stage involves a plausibility check and data transfer, monitoring of returns, and IT-supported 
evaluation of the data.  

The walk-through procedure has several advantages, including the capture of actually performed activities and 
comprehensive business process information. However, it also has some disadvantages, such as the burden on the 
task holder, the possibility of data manipulations, and the paper-based procedure.  Practical tips include 
emphasizing normal processing and regular rounds for support. In conclusion, the walk-through procedure provides
detailed insights into business processes, albeit with certain limitations and challenges. 
Careful preparation and implementation are crucial for meaningful results.
